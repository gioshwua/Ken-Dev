            I am Kenneth Joshua O. Rea√±o, a Junior Software Developer with a
            passion for creating user-friendly and efficient software solutions.
            With a strong academic background, having earned a Bachelor of
            Science in Computer Science from Batangas State University (Cum
            Laude, 1.53 GWA), I possess a solid foundation in areas such as Data
            Structure and Algorithm, Object-Oriented Programming, Software
            Engineering, Machine Learning, and Information Management.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base text-gray-400">
            I recently gained valuable experience as a Junior Software Developer
            at CP Health Innovations, where I developed user-friendly frontend
            interfaces for a collaborative health program management system. I
            integrated advanced data analytics tools to monitor and evaluate
            program outcomes, providing actionable insights for continuous
            improvement. Throughout this role, I conducted extensive user
            testing, gathered feedback to refine the user experience, and
            optimized the web application's loading speed and performance.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base text-gray-400">
            Beyond my technical proficiencies, which include expertise in
            languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Java, Python, and
            C++, as well as frameworks such as React JS/TS, Angular JS, and
            Ionic, I am a collaborative team player. At CP Health Innovations, I
            worked closely with UX/UI designers, backend developers, and project
            managers to deliver cohesive and efficient solutions. My strong
            communication skills, attention to detail, and commitment to
            continuous improvement make me a valuable asset to any software
            development team.

            worked with, I started programming about +
            {calculateDuration('2020-01-01', false)} ago. I have tried a few
            programming languages and technology stack, both Backend and

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            I am interested in learning Backend with other language like Java, Go or with Python. I also want to know how to make a video game with Unity or other and I am very interested in being a content creator whether programming or something else.
          </p>

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            For now I'm learning how to make applications with real time communication such as a chat using Socket.IO, I'm also starting to learn the way to be Devops using Docker, Kubernetes, AWS or others.
          </p>

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            I am also interested in learning other things besides programming such as 3D design with Blender and video editing with Davinci Resolve (these last two I would take as a hobby).
